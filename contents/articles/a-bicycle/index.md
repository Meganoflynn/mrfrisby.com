When I lived in Fukuoka I used to zip around on a little city bike, it was white - really white - and so I named it (as a football geek would) after Andrés Iniesta, the pale impresario at the heart of the Barcelona & Spain midfield. 

Andrés was a great little bike, and being in Japan meant that I was never in danger of being maimed by a passing car or having my bike stolen from some far-flung outreach of the city. I would just jump on it of an evening and ride off in one direction or another, ending up in places which the few foreigners in the city rarely visited. I'd cycle through suburban neighbourhoods and out of town retail complexes, to fishing outposts and motorway intersections none of which I could tell you the names of. It was on my bike that I saw the best of Fukuoka, and through cycling that I was able to enjoy Japan properly, watching it pass by me, passing by it & being a part of a giant, moving ecosystem of people and machines.

And so here I am in Amsterdam - the European Capital of the bicycle - and I've only just got around to buying a bike, and I've yet to ride it anywhere I haven't needed to go. For Amsterdam is not quite the same as Fukuoka, one isn't part of an ecosystem here so much as a rusting nail in an violent sea of rusting nails, all scraping against each other and vying for top spot and causing harm, and popping tyres and severing arteries. Trams & tramlines, throngs of camera-toting tourists,stupid scooters and their moronic-drivers, one gets the feeling that Amsterdam is designed not for cyclists, but for a transportationary conflict designed to extinguish all but the victorious. And so I've yet to venture south of home in the direction of the sprawling-flats on North Holland, I've yet to cross the Amstel in east to explore. I have however decided upon a new name for my new bike. As white as Andrés was, my new bike is black. And so whilst fearing some sort of racial faux-pas I have decided to name this bike after a black footballer - and could think of no more enjoyable a name to utter than that of the DR Congo & former Newcastle United striker; Lomana LuaLua. I'll be calling him LuaLua for short.
