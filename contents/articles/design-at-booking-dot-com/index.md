I was invited to give a talk at the February edition of the [Amsterdam UX Cocktail Hours](http://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-UX-Cocktail-Hours/), my slides are below.

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="7bc7f940526a013057e512313d1938b1" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="http://speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

The general thrust of my talk was in describing our preferred way of improving our platform, and some of the ways in which the industry at large finds that difficult to reconcile. I talked about the ROI of design and the success metrics which are an inherit part of being a designer at one of the worlds biggest e-commerce properties. We had a very interested Q&A session to end, with people largely curious about the motivations of a designer working on a single site in an iterative fashion, and wondering about how the organised chaos of our environment supports information sharing. It was a lot of fun, and the longest I've ever spoken about work stuff on stage for. Hopefully I'll have more opportunities to talk shop for such appreciative and impressive people in the future.
