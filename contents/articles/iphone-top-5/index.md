## Music+
A very close relative of the built-in Music app with a single feature which justifies it being its replacement - last.fm scrobbling. I've been using audioscrobbler/last.fm for long enough that this is a really big deal.

## Instagram
The best iPhone application. I know people get all prissy about the silly filters and the silly tilt-shifting, but for someone with zero photographical talent â€“ instagram is the perfect photo app.

## Viber
I can call, text & picture message my family in New Zealand, my friends in Japan, and the poor bastards stuck in England for free. For Free. And it looks & works like a native app (this is why it's better than WhatsApp) it integrates with your address book, it rings, it's cracking.

## Reeder
Because I'm an internet old-guy by now I obviously have a massive list of RSS subscriptions which I have entrusted to uncle Google. Reeder is the best RSS reeder I've used on the iPhone, and is more enjoyable even than the very accomplished OS X version.

## Twitter
Yeah, the new one. I like it. I like it more than the previous version. I rarely send direct messages & have found myself using twitter on my phone more since the update.
