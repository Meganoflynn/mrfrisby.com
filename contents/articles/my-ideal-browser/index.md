I've grown frustrated with how bloated Chrome & Safari have become as they strive to be conduits and gateways into the respective empires of their stewards. When once upon a time I could consider Chrome and Safari as lightweight alternatives to Firefox, I am now unable to split three in terms of bloat. 

My web browsing needs are pretty simple. I don't need a hand-holding UI, I don't need a comprehensive plugin and extension architecture, I don't even need bookmarks, they're elsewhere and divorced from any given browser as well they should be - I just need a window, tabs, and a place to enter a URL.

The closest I can get to my ideal setup is a [fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com) <sup><a href="#1" id="f1">[1]</a></sup> instance robbed of its' typical single-site nature. In it's favour - It's a webkit-based, stripped down browser designer to get out of your way. This is what my browser generally looks like:

!['browser' - Browser Window](http://goo.gl/kIerz)

I use my keyboard for the trivial things a browser UI generally tries to help you with, back/forward navigation, refreshing, opening tabs, performing a web search, entering a URL, etc. Therefore seeing those things in the chrome is a waste of expensive vertical space on my 13 inch display & a tawdry distraction from actually using the web. 

[Fluid](http://fluidapp.com) isn't perfect in this role, and nor should it be since this is absolutely not what Todd intended for it, but I think it's a good starting point in thinking about how a browser should behave. We have enough 'distraction-free' text editors, maybe it's time for that idea to spread into the place where we all spend the majority of our time. Because you know what, if you can have 'distraction-free' web browser, you can have a distraction-free anything, so long as you can build 'anything' for the web. If you'll permit the use of a clumsy metaphor, a web browser is a window on the internet, and a good window does nothing more than frame a spectacular view, it doesn't ask you to zoom in on it, or share it with your friends, it just frames it.
