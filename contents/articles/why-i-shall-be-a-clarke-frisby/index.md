Either-side of proposing to my darling Victoria last December - and in the months since - a battle has raged in the Clarke/Frisby household over the naming of my wife-to-be and our would-be offspring. I had defaulted to a position borne of a warm-fuzzy sense of traditionalism, of asserting my claim to ownership over my family, of following blindly in the footsteps of my father, and his father before him.

Victoria was never going to stand for that, and so we argued on at least three occasions over what her married name would be. There was - after the third bout - an uneasy concession on either-side which would see Victoria take my name & add it to hers. The war was over, my territory had remained unthreatened.

However, riding along with my lovely fianc√©e on her tireless, spirited fight for gender equality, and realising the error of my ways - I decided that the fairest, most equitable, warm-fuzziest thing to do is for both of us to take both of our names. And so once married I shall be Stuart Clarke-Frisby and Victoria will become Victoria (Clarkey) Clarke-Frisby. It occurred to me that there really is little sense in Victoria taking my name, for starters: it's faintly ridiculous & my families form par-excellence in the reproductive stakes means there is no threat to the good name Frisby from dying out anytime soon. But, there is something to be said for uniting under a single banner, for forming a public alliance, for nailing your flag to a syllabically-rich pole. And there is also something to be said for starting our married life under such a banner. We both know in our relationship that no quarter is given to the traditionally-demeaning gender roles of old, and that we are - and will remain - equals. And so in taking our name we demonstrate.

Yes, it's going to be an administrative nightmare, no I haven't checked if mrclarkefrisby.com is available for purchase and yes I do worry what will happen if our children in turn marry double-barrelled beaus. The thought of a [Chumley-Warner-Clarke-Frisby](http://youtu.be/SjxY9rZwNGU) is not worth thinking about; but neither is the idea that enforcing my name upon Victoria is the right way to formalise my promise to love & respect her for the rest of our lives.
