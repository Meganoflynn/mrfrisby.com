We've finally moved into our lovely apartment in Amsterdam having spent our first couple of weeks in the Netherlands staying in a Serviced Apartment just south of the city.

We're now a lot closer to town, with my office just a brisk fifteen minute walk away & all of Amsterdam's museums, restaurants and canals on our doorstep. We've yet to get all of our stuff shipped over from New Zealand so the place is looking pretty sparse at the minute, but we were lucky to find somewhere furnished so we're not quite camping out. Anyway, here are a few photos of the apartment.
