I was sitting in a bar in Tokyo last night watching my current hometown club, Ajax get overturned by a Vitesse Arnhem team containing [Mike Havenaar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Havenaar) - who I watched playing for Avispa Fukuoka when I was living in Japan in 2007 & [Patrick van Aanholt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_van_Aanholt) who was a couple of years ago playing for my boyhood team, Coventry City. 

Rounding off the list of coincidences, Ajax midfielder [Christian Poulsen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Poulsen) had a season at Liverpool, my university city.

**I wonder how often those four places are represented in a single football game, and for how many people those are the four most significant of their former homes.**
