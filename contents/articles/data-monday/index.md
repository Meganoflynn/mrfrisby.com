The numbers quoted here are impressive: [lukew.com - Impact of Responsive Designs](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1691) - however, I have a couple of problems with them:

Firstly, These are all 'redesigns', so - was the **only** change that the existing sites went from being non-responsive to responsive? If not, what else was changed, and how can the upturn in - *for example* - conversion, be attributed to one but not the other? 

When you bundle up lots of changes, you lose the ability to attribute changes in user impact; which isn't a problem if you're [Time.com](http://time.com) and you want a great looking new website that works on mobile, it is however a problem when we start retrospectively attributing impact to suit a narrative. 

Seconday, let's see some absolute numbers, whilst a *'407.3% conversion rate increase on Android devices'* sounds impressive, I can't tell if we're talking about differences in the dozens, hundreds or thousands. Without that, I start to question the statistical significance of the claim. 

I think responsively-designed websites are the inevitable direction that the web is going in, I've talked about that at length, and I argue that point with people who object to it on a daily basis. But, before I can hold up numbers like these and believe them, and believe them to be significant, they're meaningless.

My final objection is one which I hope is solved soon - that is, I want to see these numbers coming from an Amazon or eBay, real transactional websites who count success in dollars, not in pageviews. With all due respect to [Skinnyties](http://skinnyties.com) - _which is lovely_ - they're not a big enough trail blazer for a big ecommerce shop to follow in the footsteps of.

I'd love to see our industry commit to some proper user research around Responsive Design, to try and understand what we're doing to normal people's ability to use and understand the web. I'd also like to see real scientific experimentation of responsive vs non-responsive without  all of the additional change which the cited examples in Luke's post came with. Does the mere addition of device-agnostic layout make a difference, what is that difference, is it good, is it reproduceable, is it significant?
