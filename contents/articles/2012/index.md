Whilst I haven't given up all hope of being selected for the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic football team for London 2012, I thought I would assemble some additional thoughts & aims for the coming year–if only to provide reference as to the extent of my failures to look back on in glorious self-loathing.

#### Stay Home
This year I have flown around the world twice & have crossed the English Channel twelve times. I hope next year to travel a lot less. I am tired, I'm sick of airports and I'm fed up of sleeping in unfamiliar beds. I'd rather spend weekends getting to know Amsterdam better, not visiting – and thus being reminded of all of my many reasons for wanting to leave – England.

#### Be Less
My gluttony, laziness & lack of consideration for this–my only vessel has scaled new heights in 2011; I hope to eat less, weigh less, exercise more and generally take better care of myself. I don't quite know what that means in practical terms yet.

#### Make Stuff
I want to write more music, make more bits of internet & become better at doing both. I have a couple of side-projects lined-up which I hope will provide adequate creative outlet. I keep lamenting my lack of tactile skills, maybe that is something I can fix too.

#### Get Hitched
In December Victoria & I will be getting married, the year will therefore be full of plans and bills and the build up to the big, awesome day. We have chosen a venue, have a vague plan for our day and will be figuring out all of the details in the coming months. I know this is going to be a stressful, expensive and fraught process & so remembering why we are getting married and that it is a joyous and amazing thing to do is definitely something I have to continue to do.
