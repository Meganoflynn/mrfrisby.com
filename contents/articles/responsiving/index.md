So, yesterday I deployed a half-arsed joke to my website for nothing more than shits and equal quantities of giggles (one must get their shiggle ratio right). My intention wasn't to offend or upset anyone, just to play a little practical joke on those people who are inclined to resize their browser window.

Turns out that quite a lot of people thought it was funny, which was nice, I thought it was funny too. What it did show however is that for every ten normal, well-humoured adults with whom I am honoured to share a profession, there is one small-minded, humourless cretin just waiting to take everything way too seriously.</p>
