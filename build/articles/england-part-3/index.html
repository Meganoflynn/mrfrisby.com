            <article class="post"><p>We just got back from a week in England. The first time I&apos;ve spent any real time there since leaving for New Zealand having returned from Japan in 2009 &amp; 2008. It was lovely being there, seeing my old hometown, seeing my grandparents and youngest sister on the eve of her return to the antipodes. It was lovely too to be surrounded (albeit in large part from the warm asphlat of the M1, M6, M42 &amp; M69) by British countryside in autumn, with the colours turning and the air crisp. It was lovely. Bit easy though…

</p>
<p>The nice thing about being in another country (and more specifically one where the native tongue is not English) is that everything becomes just a little bit more of a challenge. Here in the Netherlands I can justify being a little bit lazier because everything requires a little more brain work. I can convince my weak, shallow mind that sitting in front of the television is a cultural and linguitic education of enormous worth. I can write off evenings spent in the local pub or scoffing at the nearest restaurant as time and money well spent immersing oneself in the locale and its folk. I can do everything here I can do in England, but be a little less self-loathing in doing it. And that sounds like a very small deal, but for someone inherantly lazy — but curious — that makes life significantly easier, and loads more interestinger.

</p>
<h4>That being said, here are a few things I would like to import in bulk to Amsterdam:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ginsters Cornish Pasties (I know, but what a way to go!)</li>
<li>GMT (staying up until the wee hours for Match of the Day &amp; Newsnight is an affront)</li>
<li>The Guardian (I still can&apos;t quite make that final 5% of the jump to digital only news)</li>
<li>The red button. We saw Elbow from Manchester Cathedral a few nights ago, what a treat.</li>
</ul>
