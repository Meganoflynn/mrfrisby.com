            <article class="post"><p>The numbers quoted here are impressive: <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1691">lukew.com - Impact of Responsive Designs</a> - however, I have a couple of problems with them:

</p>
<p>Firstly, These are all &apos;redesigns&apos;, so - was the <strong>only</strong> change that the existing sites went from being non-responsive to responsive? If not, what else was changed, and how can the upturn in - <em>for example</em> - conversion, be attributed to one but not the other? 

</p>
<p>When you bundle up lots of changes, you lose the ability to attribute changes in user impact; which isn&apos;t a problem if you&apos;re <a href="http://time.com">Time.com</a> and you want a great looking new website that works on mobile, it is however a problem when we start retrospectively attributing impact to suit a narrative. 

</p>
<p>Seconday, let&apos;s see some absolute numbers, whilst a <em>&apos;407.3% conversion rate increase on Android devices&apos;</em> sounds impressive, I can&apos;t tell if we&apos;re talking about differences in the dozens, hundreds or thousands. Without that, I start to question the statistical significance of the claim. 

</p>
<p>I think responsively-designed websites are the inevitable direction that the web is going in, I&apos;ve talked about that at length, and I argue that point with people who object to it on a daily basis. But, before I can hold up numbers like these and believe them, and believe them to be significant, they&apos;re meaningless.

</p>
<p>My final objection is one which I hope is solved soon - that is, I want to see these numbers coming from an Amazon or eBay, real transactional websites who count success in dollars, not in pageviews. With all due respect to <a href="http://skinnyties.com">Skinnyties</a> - <em>which is lovely</em> - they&apos;re not a big enough trail blazer for a big ecommerce shop to follow in the footsteps of.

</p>
<p>I&apos;d love to see our industry commit to some proper user research around Responsive Design, to try and understand what we&apos;re doing to normal people&apos;s ability to use and understand the web. I&apos;d also like to see real scientific experimentation of responsive vs non-responsive without  all of the additional change which the cited examples in Luke&apos;s post came with. Does the mere addition of device-agnostic layout make a difference, what is that difference, is it good, is it reproduceable, is it significant? </p>
