            <article class="post"><p>There was a time, as recently as fifteen years ago when sites were constructed based on a small set of assumptions. That your browser window was set to a specific set of dimensions, that you were using a specific browser. You&apos;d be greeted with a message informing you that &apos;this site is best viewed in Internet Explorer 5 at a screen resolution of 1024x768&apos;. You could still access the site using Netscape, and if you dared use a different size viewport, you wouldn&apos;t be kicked back to <a href="http://lycos.com">lycos</a>, but your experience might be degraded somewhat.

</p>
<p>And so here we are, in the year of our Lord 2012 - and guess what? It got worse. Instead of using screen resolution and UA string as the determining factors for a customer experience, we&apos;re using inches. And even worse than that - you very often can&apos;t opt out anymore.

</p>
<p>You&apos;re using a 9 inch tablet - Oh, then you definitely want our tablet site &amp; since you&apos;re here, why don&apos;t we shove our wholly superfluous iOS app down your throat. It&apos;s like the website, only infuriatingly different.

</p>
<p>Should you deign then to try and access the same site later that same day on your android phone, you&apos;re going to get another experience - another website, another app - a site where we assume based on the girth of your device that you only need a portion of the features from the main site, which we&apos;re going to make it hard for you to find and use. We&apos;re also going to throw out all of the conventions you&apos;ve come to understand - colour, form, proportion, workflow. You&apos;re going to have to embrace chaos to get the job done - you&apos;re going to have to work harder than you did in 2001 to perform the same set of simple tasks.

</p>
<p>How far can this madness go? How many inch ranges can we identify which we can use as justifications for whole new customer experiences? Do we need a site which is crafted for your 42 inch TV, your 90 inch projector screen, your dual 30 inch monitors? There&apos;s a big screen at Wembley stadium which must measure in the hundreds of inches - are you going to build an app for that too? Do we need an app for every platform, or two apps, or an app per platform per form factor per orientation? Where does this madness end?

</p>
<p>How can you hope to deliver a consistent, predictable end-to-end, multi-screen experience to your user base if you change the furniture every time they look into your house through a different window? How hard do your users have to work to find the same piece of task-critical information on all of the devices you purport to support? And there&apos;s the crux of the issue: with your inch-based platform strategy - what are you supporting - users, or devices?

</p>
<p>The internet will win. I&apos;m going all in on that belief. That in the vast, overwhelming majority of cases - the internet is enough. That HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript will see you home. That a core platform built on the core premise of a single, unified customer experience is best realised through these technologies, and through whichever browser/OS/Viewport size you use. The internet doesn&apos;t care how wide your device is, how tall it is, which version of whichever operating system you&apos;re using. The internet is built for the full gamut of devices, people, cultures &amp; conventions. (Responsibly) Responsive design is the shining example of this theory made true in an increasingly diverse device-ecosystem, but it isn&apos;t a black sheep, this is what the internet has always been for. Let&apos;s not try and retrofit unity across platforms, let&apos;s embrace the single platform which is the internet and be smart about giving an equitable user experience to everyone who rocks up at our front door, regardless of who they are.</p>
