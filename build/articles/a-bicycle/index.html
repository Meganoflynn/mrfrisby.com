            <article class="post"><p>When I lived in Fukuoka I used to zip around on a little city bike, it was white - really white - and so I named it (as a football geek would) after Andrés Iniesta, the pale impresario at the heart of the Barcelona &amp; Spain midfield. 

</p>
<p>Andrés was a great little bike, and being in Japan meant that I was never in danger of being maimed by a passing car or having my bike stolen from some far-flung outreach of the city. I would just jump on it of an evening and ride off in one direction or another, ending up in places which the few foreigners in the city rarely visited. I&apos;d cycle through suburban neighbourhoods and out of town retail complexes, to fishing outposts and motorway intersections none of which I could tell you the names of. It was on my bike that I saw the best of Fukuoka, and through cycling that I was able to enjoy Japan properly, watching it pass by me, passing by it &amp; being a part of a giant, moving ecosystem of people and machines.

</p>
<p>And so here I am in Amsterdam - the European Capital of the bicycle - and I&apos;ve only just got around to buying a bike, and I&apos;ve yet to ride it anywhere I haven&apos;t needed to go. For Amsterdam is not quite the same as Fukuoka, one isn&apos;t part of an ecosystem here so much as a rusting nail in an violent sea of rusting nails, all scraping against each other and vying for top spot and causing harm, and popping tyres and severing arteries. Trams &amp; tramlines, throngs of camera-toting tourists,stupid scooters and their moronic-drivers, one gets the feeling that Amsterdam is designed not for cyclists, but for a transportationary conflict designed to extinguish all but the victorious. And so I&apos;ve yet to venture south of home in the direction of the sprawling-flats on North Holland, I&apos;ve yet to cross the Amstel in east to explore. I have however decided upon a new name for my new bike. As white as Andrés was, my new bike is black. And so whilst fearing some sort of racial faux-pas I have decided to name this bike after a black footballer - and could think of no more enjoyable a name to utter than that of the DR Congo &amp; former Newcastle United striker; Lomana LuaLua. I&apos;ll be calling him LuaLua for short.
