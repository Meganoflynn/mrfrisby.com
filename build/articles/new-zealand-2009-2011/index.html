            <article class="post"><p>When Victoria and I left The UK for New Zealand in June of 2009 we planned to spend two or three years there, but beyond that – and the offer of a place to stay with my parents – we had no idea what we would do, where we would go, or what would come of us. I had gone to New Zealand with a tentative job prospect which subsequently fell through due to a complete lack of competency on the part of the New Zealand Immigration Service and a matching degree of stupidity and short-sightedness from my would be employer. It turned out to be a blessing in a rather cunning disguise.

</p>
<p>With that opportunity gone we decided to move to Karamea on the North-Western shoulder of the South Island where we lived and worked at Rongo Backpackers, a place situated in an almost preposterously beautiful part of this preposterously beautiful country. We spent three months living there, helping out at the backpackers, revelling in the Radio Station and doing our bit to make Rongo Backpackers one of the most incredible places you&apos;ll ever visit.

</p>
<p>Our time there came to its end and so three months after our arrival we flew back to my parents place in the Bay of Plenty and enjoyed a few months there on the beach - sharing the waters with school sharks, active volcanoes &amp; dolphin royalty. The next stop on our journey was a move to the nation&apos;s capital city, Wellington. We&apos;d passed through on our journey down south and felt confident it was our kind of place, a good food city with a great museum all overlooking a great body of water, the similarities to our beloved Liverpool were pretty self-evident, and very appealing. I got a job working at NV Interactive, a digital agency working with a broad base of New Zealand clients, from the online home of the national cricket team through to heritage kiwi brands and small businesses. I had a good year at NV working with a number of very talented people (special mentions to Tim McConnell and Sam Langley with whom I had a great time working. We shared an outlook on the work we did and a passion for doing it well which made our working together a great experience for me).

</p>
<p>The two major seismic events which shook Christchurch during the last twelve months had a big impact on the company - the main office being based in the Christchurch CBD - the second quake resulted in the demolition of the office, the displacement of a number of our colleagues, and in some cases the loss of lives amongst the large Canterbury contingent of NV Interactive&apos;s client base. It was a difficult time, but one which bought to the fore the great spirit of togetherness of New Zealand, it was very much a national event and it was incredible to see a country united in doing their bit to help their friends in Canterbury.

</p>
<p>Disasters aside I left NV having made some important contributions to the business. I introduced an internal social network via which the two offices would be permanently connected, I initiated the companies first steps into a social media presence, helped establish the first style guide for writing CSS and through general pestering and persistence contributed towards the decisions to embrace HTML5 as our default authoring language &amp; to drop implicit IE6 support on all new projects. I also benefitted from being able to really hone my craft. I&apos;ve been doing this stuff a long time, but my year at NV was perhaps the first period where I had the time and resources to develop my understanding of HTML and CSS to a new level. I have become a more responsible and cultured writer of code and for the opportunity to do that I am most grateful. It would be remiss of me however to neglect to mention the more difficult aspects of my time with NV. The two office structure never really felt like it worked properly and we in Wellington (as the smaller, satellite office) were always on the back-foot when working cross office on big projects. It&apos;s something I know the guys are keen to improve upon, and I hope that happens because there is great potential amongst the awesome staff there to do incredible things, if only the processes and tools could be introduced to make that possible. The second tricky aspect of my role was that as a traditionally development focused agency, design was always a poor cousin to development, and that ethos spilt over into projects too frequently for my liking. A general apathy towards the theories of UX design, and a skepticism relating to the field made creating great interfaces a difficult task. I insisted upon a greater focus on lo-fi design work early in projects - wireframes, prototyping, interactive sketching, but the value of these tools were never truly understood as being the building blocks of a site. The disconnect between development, design and management of projects saw that these exercises were, more or less, futile. That does not however mean that I don&apos;t have a huge amount of respect and admiration for the team at NV Interactive, they&apos;re a fantastic bunch of people doing great work under difficult circumstances and I feel confident in suggesting that they are still set on becoming a big player in the web scene in NZ. That the company were awarded four finalists at their first foray into the ONYA Awards is testament to that fact and I hope I&apos;ll be seeing the company name pop up in all sorts of places over the coming years.

</p>
<p>Having decided that it was time for a new challenge I flew out to Amsterdam in February to interview with booking.com, and here we are a few short months later in a hotel just south of the city, waiting to hear if we&apos;ve landed the apartment we like and planning our lives in this exciting European city with all of the museums, culture and history you could want in a hometown. I start work in the design team at booking.com on Friday, and I am looking forward to a long and happy stay in Amsterdam and with my new employers. It&apos;s an exciting step for me &amp; one which I believe is going to again help me to become a better designer.</p>
