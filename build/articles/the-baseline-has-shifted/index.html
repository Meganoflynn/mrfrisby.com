            <article class="post"><p>When I was 15 I used to spend all of the money I could wangle out of my parents to buy bootleg CDs of my favourite bands playing live versions of as-yet-unreleased material. They sounded like shit. They sounded like shit and I paid for them. I paid for them because my fervour demanded I have them, and because the shitty version was the only version, it was the version I&apos;d buy.

</p>
<p>Fast-forward a dozen years: My fervour has cooled and I&apos;m happy to wait for a song to be released before buying it. The bootlegs are still available, but when it comes to making a decision between the shitty version recorded in a loud concert hall, and the version recorded in a studio and intended for home play, there&apos;s an obvious winner.

</p>
<p>And that long-winded introduction is a clumsy metaphor for the internet. An internet where just a few years ago the base expectation was that everything was a bit shitty. It was the best we had, and we used it and revelled in it - but it really was a bit crap. Google didn&apos;t know what you were looking for, browsers weren&apos;t capable of rendering consistently, services were information silos and the patterns of design for the web hadn&apos;t been established and honed and everything was confusing and inconsistent and odd.

</p>
<p>Things are better now. People have decent internet connections, Google knows more about you than Tesco, your data is liberated from the clutches of corporations and the internet increasingly looks great, and works wonderfully. Mobile devices and platforms are bringing the best of Human Interface Design to the masses, and the big internet heavyweights - Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. - are investing in design like never before. Just like when I stopped buying those bootleg CDs, I&apos;ve stopped being forgiving of crap user experience, inconsistent design &amp; poorly considered user-flow. And I don&apos;t think it&apos;s just me. Apple - whether you like it or not - are educating a generation of consumers that user experience need not be analogous to a shitty bootleg, that design is synonymous with quality, with security, with integrity. That if something looks like shit, feels like shit &amp; treats you like shit - it probably is shit.

</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people are carrying iPhones &amp; using facebook. They know good design, even if they don&apos;t know the jargon. Startup folks are right to identify designers as the kingmakers of new online companies; but big business needs to get there too: In a global marketplace, where design has a value of its own, it&apos;s not going to suffice to be good enough anymore. And what a fantastic challenge it is that lays before all of us who make websites. To stop settling for the mediocre, to talk about design not in terms of window-dressing, but experience-forming. To switch the pivot point from satisfaction to <a href="http://talks.webstock.org.nz/speakers/doug-bowman/delivering-delight/">delight</a>.

</p>
<p>If you design websites and don&apos;t aim to delight - do something else. If you design websites and think good enough is good enough - do something else. If this brave new world where design is a currency and you hold the cheque book doesn&apos;t make your heart flutter and your mind run wild with possibilities - do something else. The years in which web designers could get away with being average are coming to an end, and it is the engaged, enthusiastic, eager-to-please who are going to see their value rise in this new design-cognisant digital economy. Excited? Fucking right I am.</p>
