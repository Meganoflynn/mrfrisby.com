            <article class="post"><p>Living in Amsterdam (where I&apos;m very happy!), I&apos;m becoming accustomed to dreadful - or completely absent - customer service. There doesn&apos;t seem to be a correlation here between the quality of a product, and the service with which it&apos;s delivered. Some of my favourite restaurants are staffed by people verging on hostile, and it doesn&apos;t improve inline with cost.

</p>
<p>At the low-end of most markets, the internet works in much the same way. Consider Ryanair: where the product and the way in which it is sold are perfectly congruous. You&apos;re treated on their website just like you&apos;re treated on their planes - packed in, confused into extra spending &amp; generally made to feel like a piece of abnormal-freight.

</p>
<p>At the other end of the market, you have niche, luxury operators who know that the customer experience is end-to-end, from the first impression on their website, to the post-transactional communications. JetSetter.com is a good example of this kind of application of delight in an interface: High quality images, restrained UI elements, space &amp; a gentle, assured tone of voice. A website sets an expectation for the experience to follow. JetSetter.com treats you like a valued and respected individual, just like a diligent concierge at the sort of high-class hotel you&apos;ll find on the site.

</p>
<h2>But what about the wide middle?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of companies exist somewhere between these two poles, serving varied product to varied customers - and requiring such in order to prosper. For these businesses, delightfulness in a user interface can become a key differentiator which elevates it above the competition who default to the ordinary, and fail to delight. Given the choice of two stores selling the same range of products, would you chose the one staffed by the ryanair-esque shopkeeper, or the jetsetter-like assistant? Your UI is your shopfront and your shopstaff. It&apos;s the language with which you talk to your customers, the space you give them to make a decision, the gentle hand in the right direction at the right moment that turns an average user experience into an enjoyable one. And it&apos;s my belief that people will always gravitate towards the companies and services which treat them well and make them feel empowered, not embarrassed. The effect might be magnified as the purchase price goes up, but even when you&apos;re spending €5 on a paperback, you&apos;d sooner do it in a beautiful old book store than a soulless warehouse.

</p>
<p>The challenge for UX designers is to figure out how to find this balance, to offer an appropriate experience inline with the full gamut of products on offer - to optimise for sales, and build for delight. To build something which adds to even the most high-cost purchase, and can massively elevate the experience of buying the most mundane, inexpensive goods.

</p>
<p>And surely this truth is universal. Surely everyone wants to be treated well, people&apos;s ability to recognise good customer experience when online may be less established than in a physical store - but that&apos;s only going to improve. People are going to be more able to distinguish between Ryanair.com &amp; JetSetter.com, not less, and why would anyone knowingly choose that which makes them less happy?
