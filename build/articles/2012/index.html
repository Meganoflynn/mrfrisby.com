            <article class="post"><p>Whilst I haven&apos;t given up all hope of being selected for the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic football team for London 2012, I thought I would assemble some additional thoughts &amp; aims for the coming year–if only to provide reference as to the extent of my failures to look back on in glorious self-loathing.

</p>
<h4>Stay Home</h4>
<p>This year I have flown around the world twice &amp; have crossed the English Channel twelve times. I hope next year to travel a lot less. I am tired, I&apos;m sick of airports and I&apos;m fed up of sleeping in unfamiliar beds. I&apos;d rather spend weekends getting to know Amsterdam better, not visiting – and thus being reminded of all of my many reasons for wanting to leave – England.

</p>
<h4>Be Less</h4>
<p>My gluttony, laziness &amp; lack of consideration for this–my only vessel has scaled new heights in 2011; I hope to eat less, weigh less, exercise more and generally take better care of myself. I don&apos;t quite know what that means in practical terms yet.

</p>
<h4>Make Stuff</h4>
<p>I want to write more music, make more bits of internet &amp; become better at doing both. I have a couple of side-projects lined-up which I hope will provide adequate creative outlet. I keep lamenting my lack of tactile skills, maybe that is something I can fix too.

</p>
<h4>Get Hitched</h4>
<p>In December Victoria &amp; I will be getting married, the year will therefore be full of plans and bills and the build up to the big, awesome day. We have chosen a venue, have a vague plan for our day and will be figuring out all of the details in the coming months. I know this is going to be a stressful, expensive and fraught process &amp; so remembering why we are getting married and that it is a joyous and amazing thing to do is definitely something I have to continue to do.</p>
