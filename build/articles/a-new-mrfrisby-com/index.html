            <article class="post"><p>When I set live the previous version of this site, it was the simplest thing I could release - a set of static HTML files, authored inside my text editor, everything written by hand and augmented by the occasional TextExpander shortcut. I talked then about how <code>HTML</code> &amp; <code>CSS</code> are my environment, and so writing and managing a site in them was natural for me. 

</p>
<p>Having worked that way for a little over a year, I started to lament the tedium of a few little tasks which accompanied posting a new article - manually adding a new entry to my <code>RSS</code> feed <em>(which I kept fucking up, as <a href="http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com/">Matthew</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.deepakg.com/">Deepak</a> we&apos;re all too happy to point out)</em>, cross-referencing new posts on various other parts of the site, yadda, yadda. They were pretty minor complaints though, and so when I decided I wanted to solve them I went looking for something that was almost as simple as my handspun system, but meant I&apos;d be doing less donkey work. 

</p>
<p>After trying to install/compile/read-the-docs-of many static site generators and failing at various ill-documented stages, I ended up getting along rather better with <a href="http://jnordberg.github.com/wintersmith/">Wintersmith</a> by <a href="http://johan-nordberg.com/">Johan Nordberg</a> - which was well documented and easy to get going. The <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a> templates are taking some getting used to, but I&apos;m enjoying it, and finding it quite trivial to extend and bend it to my will here on this new version of my site. That it&apos;s static means I can keep it synced across machines via dropbox and add new posts from anywhere I can write a markdown file. 

</p>
<p>The keen-eyed amongst you will also have noticed that this version is somewhat responsive, but that&apos;s hardly a difficult task for what is essentially a collection of text documents. Design-wise I&apos;ve been influenced in the main-part by <a href="http://monocle.com">Monocle</a> and it&apos;s lovely editorial design - I stopped short of creating a complete remake, but the influence is pretty self-evident for anyone that reads it. In place of <a href="http://goo.gl/KYmQi">Plantin</a> I&apos;m using <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Gentium+Book+Basic">Gentium Book Basic</a>, which is a lot less lovely, but a lot more available. You can read a bit about Monocle&apos;s type design in <a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/in-use-plantin-for-monocle/">this 2009 article</a> from Font Feed, this quote in particular sums up the retrained quality the publication exudes: 

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] I think that if you want to build something to last it should have a confident permanent look. Something that doesn’t reinvent itself every 6 months. Plus I have always found that restraint and a tight set of rules actually prompts more creative solutions. We always look at ways to use Plantin, not ways to replace it. <cite>Monocle Creative Director - Richard Spencer Powell</cite>

<p>I&apos;m also bringing back comments for the first time in years on posts for which opportunities for discussion exist - they&apos;re the same <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> comments you find everywhere else. If you&apos;re curious to see how they or anything else here in implemented, the full source is on <a href="https://github.com/scfrisby/mrfrisby.com">github</a>. 

</p>
<p>If you spot anything broken, do give me a shout - I&apos;m still fiddling around with some stuff and will get around to adding an about page at some point, but this&apos;ll do for now. </p>
