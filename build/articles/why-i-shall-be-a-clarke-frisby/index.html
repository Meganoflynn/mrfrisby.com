            <article class="post"><p>Either-side of proposing to my darling Victoria last December - and in the months since - a battle has raged in the Clarke/Frisby household over the naming of my wife-to-be and our would-be offspring. I had defaulted to a position borne of a warm-fuzzy sense of traditionalism, of asserting my claim to ownership over my family, of following blindly in the footsteps of my father, and his father before him.

</p>
<p>Victoria was never going to stand for that, and so we argued on at least three occasions over what her married name would be. There was - after the third bout - an uneasy concession on either-side which would see Victoria take my name &amp; add it to hers. The war was over, my territory had remained unthreatened.

</p>
<p>However, riding along with my lovely fiancée on her tireless, spirited fight for gender equality, and realising the error of my ways - I decided that the fairest, most equitable, warm-fuzziest thing to do is for both of us to take both of our names. And so once married I shall be Stuart Clarke-Frisby and Victoria will become Victoria (Clarkey) Clarke-Frisby. It occurred to me that there really is little sense in Victoria taking my name, for starters: it&apos;s faintly ridiculous &amp; my families form par-excellence in the reproductive stakes means there is no threat to the good name Frisby from dying out anytime soon. But, there is something to be said for uniting under a single banner, for forming a public alliance, for nailing your flag to a syllabically-rich pole. And there is also something to be said for starting our married life under such a banner. We both know in our relationship that no quarter is given to the traditionally-demeaning gender roles of old, and that we are - and will remain - equals. And so in taking our name we demonstrate.

</p>
<p>Yes, it&apos;s going to be an administrative nightmare, no I haven&apos;t checked if mrclarkefrisby.com is available for purchase and yes I do worry what will happen if our children in turn marry double-barrelled beaus. The thought of a <a href="http://youtu.be/SjxY9rZwNGU">Chumley-Warner-Clarke-Frisby</a> is not worth thinking about; but neither is the idea that enforcing my name upon Victoria is the right way to formalise my promise to love &amp; respect her for the rest of our lives.</p>
