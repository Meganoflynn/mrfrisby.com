            <article class="post"><p><strong>All of the whining on twitter over the FB/IG deal has cemented my thinking on the way I want to use these types of online services. I see people scrambling to backup their Instagram accounts or even shut them down, because presumably they think that facebook can determine persuasion profiles based on faux-fifties-photo-filter preferences.</strong>

</p>
<p>Here&apos;s the way I think of Instagram: It&apos;s the easiest way for me to take photographs on my phone, have them synced to my dropbox, populate an album on my Picasa account, post them to a Facebook album, tweet a link to them and post them to a page on my website. When I hit the share button in the Instagram app on my phone, an incredibly complicated sequence of events take place which seeds my silly little photo to an array of places from which I can derive some value, some enjoyment from them. That could change tomorrow, but because I value the photographs I take as petty records of time well spent, I have them. Physically have them. They&apos;re mine. The rack of servers through which they pass on their way to being liberated is irrelevant, and easily changed. I don&apos;t care that they also reside on the servers of Instagram, Facebook, Google &amp; Dropbox.

</p>
<p>I think if you care about having absolute control the content you&apos;re creating with an application, you should definitely not be renouncing ownership and guardianship of it to anyone who isn&apos;t you. Crying foul when a company is under new ownership is idiotic. Why should you trust Instagram any more than you do Facebook? If you really cared, you&apos;d never use a third-party service, or you&apos;d already be treating these services as mere conduits for content creation and liberation, regardless of who owned them. I know it&apos;s cool to bash Facebook, to assume nefarious intent. But the size of a company is not a proxy value for their trustworthiness. North Korea is a minnow in the population stakes, but is at the top table in the cuntery charts, who is to say that the same isn&apos;t true for the makers of Instagram? I know nothing about them, I&apos;m not willing to entrust them with anything of importance to me anymore than I am facebook.
